        dear mika; <br>
        i have wanted to write u a (digital) letter for a long time,<br>
        and i guess now i finally am.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="sketchblock"></div>
    <div id="block1">
      <p> i am not sure i identify as an artist. i talked to a friend about it today, and they said "it sounds like u need to expand ur notion of artist." <br>
        maybe that is true.
        <br> 
        but, maybe i dont need to identify as an artist (besides- <br>
        <em> identifying </em> as an artist seems counter intuitive; art is everything; <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/john-dewey-theory-of-art-as-experience/">art is experiential;</a> art is collective.)</p>
      
      <p id="p2">recently, i realized:</p>
      <h1 style="color: transparent; animation: effect 2s linear infinite;">
        i want my art to nourish <br>
        i want to build a future <br>
        (that i believe in)
      </h1>
      <p style="font-style: italic; color: #ccfcef;"> so, what does this look like? </p>
      <div style="color: #D897B8"><p> i am still figuring it out, but it means, so far: </p>
      <li>i want to make more collective art.</li>
      <li>i want to make media that challenges capitalism and breeds a kinder future.</li>
      <li>i want to make things that make people feel like magic is real.</li>
      </div>
      <br>
